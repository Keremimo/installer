## Roadmap

* ~~Arch github action~~
* ~~Ubuntu github action~~
* Termux github action
* ~~MacOS github action~~

I've been working on this for a week and I'm a bit burned up, so let's re-visit adding support for the remaining operative systems in the future.

* Fedora github action → For now it is more we can chew, let's release it in the future.
* NixOS github action → For now
