# Installer
Shell script to install NormalNvim in a single step.

## Supported operative systems

* Arch based Linux distros
* Ubuntu based Linux distros
* MacOS (homebrew)
* ~~Termux (currently wip)~~

## Supported GitHub actions
The fact a installer has a GitHub action, mean the installer is very stable; If any dependency cease to exist on the repositories of a distro, we will inmediatelly know.

* Arch
* Ubuntu
* MacOs

## Roadmap

I've been working on this for a week and I'm a bit burned up, so let's re-visit adding support for the remaining operative systems in the future.

* Fedora github action
