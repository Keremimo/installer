# Installer
Shell script to install NormalNvim in a single step.

## I found a bug
Very likely your issue will be about a dependency not installing correctly. If that's the case please open a issue indicating:

* Your operative system.
* The dependency failing.
* And if you know: What is the name of the actual dependency we should be installing instead.

It would help us a lot if you can send the PR directly.

## Note from the author
We try to support as many distros as possible, but we only own arch Linux machines. We need your help in order to make NormalNvim a great experience for everyone.
